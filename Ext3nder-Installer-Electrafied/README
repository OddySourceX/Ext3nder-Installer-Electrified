README This folder NEEDs to be named Ext3nder-Installer-Electrafied and it NEEDS to be put on the root of 
your phone (so /Ext3nder-Installer-Electrafied) I recommend just extracting this onto the root directory and 
you will be fine. make sure to run chmod +x ./install.sh before running, and to install all you need to do 
is ./install.sh.
